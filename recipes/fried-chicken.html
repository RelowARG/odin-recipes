    <p>This wonderful old-fashioned fried chicken recipe has been in my family for years and years.</p>

    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>â…” cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup sherry</li>
        </ul>
    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a brown paper bag.
                Add chicken pieces, one at a time, to flour mixture; shake the bag to coat evenly.
                Place coated chicken on a tray.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 inch oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
                Cook chicken in hot oil until golden brown and no longer pink in the center.
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F
                (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a paper towel-lined plate.
                Drain oil from the skillet.</li>
            <li>Return chicken to the skillet and drizzle with sherry. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
